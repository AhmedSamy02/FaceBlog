# FaceBlog - Your Blogging Playground

Welcome to **FaceBlog** – a sleek and powerful blog platform where ideas flow effortlessly! 🚀

This project marks my **first medium-sized React endeavor**, and I'm beyond excited to share it with you! Built with a passion for creating interactive, user-friendly web experiences, FaceBlog allows you to **read, create, and delete blogs** with ease.

## 🎯 Features

- **Read Blogs**: Dive into posts on a variety of topics with just a click.
- **Add New Blogs**: Got something to say? Share your thoughts instantly by creating a new post.
- **Delete Blogs**: No longer relevant or just clearing clutter? Effortlessly remove blogs from your list.

## 🗃️ Mock Data

I used **json-server** to mock the backend data for this project. You can find the `data.db` file in the `data` folder. This allows for a seamless experience while developing the app without needing a full backend setup.
